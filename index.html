    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The month-long Orange Line shutdown in October 2024 replaced 5.2 miles of rail and eliminated virtually all slow zones. Riders immediately noticed faster trips, but <strong>by how much exactly? And did reliability improve too?</strong></p>
    <p>This project answers those questions using public headway data from MBTA’s Blue Book Portal. Due to the service discrepancies between weekdays and weekends, we split our data into an equal number of pre- and post-shutdown weekdays (Oct 1–4, 7), (Nov 5-8, 11) and weekends (Oct 5-6), (Nov 9-10). For this segment, we measured::</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Speed</strong> → The end-to-end journey times (18-station trunk segment - Green St to Malden Center Northbound) and the average speed between each station segment</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability/Frequency</strong> → Headways (number of seconds between trains)</li>
    </ul>
   <p>Completed tasks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Median journey time comparison (pre vs. post, weekdays & weekends)</li>
        <li>Average headways by stop, by hour, and daily distribution</li>
        <li>Per-segment speed improvement mapping (interactive Mapbox)</li>
        <li>Percentage change and variability analysis</li>
    </ul>

<section id="static">
    <h2>Static Visualization 1: Average Headways by Stop</h2>
    <img src="headways_by_stop.png" alt="Average Headways by Stop">

    <div class="design-note">
        <strong>Design justification:</strong><br>
        • Mark: Grouped bar — ideal for direct pre/post comparison per stop<br>
        • Stops sorted by improvement magnitude → biggest winners appear first<br>
        • Color: pre = orange, post = green ("green = better")<br>
        • Faceted by weekday/weekend<br>
        • Static format makes the main story immediately visible without any interaction.
    </div>

    <h2>Static Visualization 2: Daily Average Headway Distributions</h2>
    <img src="headway_boxplots.png" alt="Daily Average Headway Boxplots">

    <div class="design-note">
        <strong>Design justification:</strong><br>
        • Mark: Boxplot — perfect for showing median + variability day-to-day<br>
        • Nearly identical boxes pre/post → instantly proves reliability did not improve<br>
        • Separate panels for weekdays vs. weekends respect different service patterns.
    </div>
</section>

<section id="interactive">
    <h2>Interactive Visualization 1: Average Headway by Time of Day</h2>

    <iframe src="headway_line_interactive.html"></iframe>

    <div class="design-note">
        <strong>Design justification:</strong><br>
        • Mark: Line — gives us insight to headways at different times of the day<br>
        • X-position: categorical combination of period (pre/post) + day_type (weekday/weekend)<br>
        • Y-position: average_headway_seconds:Q (primary quantitative key)<br>
        • Static format: the critical insight ("reliability did not improve at all") is immediately obvious from the nearly identical boxes — no interaction needed<br>
        • Separate panels for weekdays vs. weekends respect different service patterns<br>
    </div>

    <h2>Interactive Visualization 2: Average Speed by Segment Map</h2>

    <a href="speed_output.html" target="_blank" class="big-link">Open Full Interactive Speed Map</a>

    <div class="design-note">
        <strong>Design justification for the speed map:</strong><br>
        • Mark: Colored geographic line segments<br>
        • Position: real lat/lon coordinates → accurate spatial context<br>
        • Color: sequential (slow red/orange → fast blue/green)<br>
        • 2×2 facet grid clearly separates pre/post and weekday/weekend<br>
        • Hover + zoom/pan interactivity reveals precise segment-level improvements<br>
        • This is the strongest visualization: it shows not just that the line got faster, but exactly <em>where</em> and <em>by how much</em> in the real world.

<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion – What We Learned</h2>
    <p>The October 2024 Orange Line shutdown was a <strong>resounding success on speed</strong> — the speed map shows massive gains across nearly the entire line, especially in the repaired Southwest Corridor.</p>
    <p>On <strong>reliability and frequency</strong>, all visualizations agree: <strong>no meaningful improvement</strong>.<br>
    • Stop-by-stop headways: almost no change<br>
    • Daily distributions: identical boxplots<br>
    • Hourly patterns: completely overlapping lines at every hour and day type</p>
    <p><strong>Final verdict:</strong> Riders now enjoy dramatically faster trips, but still face the same waiting times and bunching. Future efforts must target operations, scheduling, and train availability — not just infrastructure.</p>
