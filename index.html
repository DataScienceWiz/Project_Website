<section id="introduction">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The month-long Orange Line shutdown in October 2024 replaced 5.2 miles of rail and eliminated virtually all slow zones. Riders immediately noticed faster trips, but <strong>by how much exactly? And did reliability improve too?</strong></p>
    <p>This project answers those questions using public headway data from MBTA’s Blue Book Portal. Due to the service discrepancies between weekdays and weekends, we split our data into an equal number of pre- and post-shutdown weekdays (Oct 1–4, 7), (Nov 5-8, 11) and weekends (Oct 5-6), (Nov 9-10). For this segment, we measured::</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Speed</strong> → The end-to-end journey times (18-station trunk segment - Green St to Malden Center Northbound) and the average speed between each station segment</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability/Frequency</strong> → Headways (number of seconds between trains)</li>
    </ul>
   <p>Completed tasks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Median journey time comparison (pre vs. post, weekdays & weekends)</li>
        <li>Average headways by stop, by hour, and daily distribution</li>
        <li>Per-segment speed improvement mapping (interactive Mapbox)</li>
        <li>Percentage change and variability analysis</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="static">
    <h2>Static Visualization 1: Average Headways by Stop (Pre vs. Post)</h2>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Immediately see which stations had the biggest reliability/frequency gains (or losses).</p>
    <img src="headways_by_stop.jpg" alt="Average Headways by Stop Pre vs Post Shutdown">

    <div class="design-note">
        <strong>Design justification:</strong><br>
        • Mark: Grouped bar — ideal for direct pre/post comparison per stop<br>
        • X-axis: stops sorted by improvement magnitude<br>
        • Y-axis: average headway (minutes) — lower = better<br>
        • Color: pre-shutdown = orange, post-shutdown = green ("green = better")<br>
        • Faceted by weekday/weekend<br>
        • Static format chosen because the key story is instantly visible without interaction.
    </div>

    <h2>Static Visualization 2: Distribution of Daily Average Headways</h2>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Compare not just the average headway, but the day-to-day consistency of train frequency before vs. after the shutdown.</p>
    <img src="headway_boxplots.png" alt="Daily Average Headway Boxplots Pre vs Post">

    <div class="design-note">
        <strong>Design justification:</strong><br>
        • Mark: Boxplot — explicitly chosen to show distribution (median, IQR, outliers) of daily average headways<br>
        • X-position: categorical combination of period (pre/post) + day_type (weekday/weekend)<br>
        • Y-position: average_headway_seconds:Q (primary quantitative key)<br>
        • Static format: the critical insight ("reliability did not improve at all") is immediately obvious from the nearly identical boxes — no interaction needed<br>
        • Separate panels for weekdays vs. weekends respect different service patterns<br>

<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion – What We Learned from All 4 Visualizations</h2>
    <p>The October 2024 shutdown was a <strong>dramatic success on speed</strong>: median journey times fell 9.1% on weekdays and 14.1% on weekends. The interactive speed-improvement map shows the gains were heavily concentrated in the Southwest Corridor where the track work was focused.</p>
    <p>On <strong>reliability and frequency</strong>, all three reliability visualizations tell the same story: <strong>essentially zero improvement</strong>.<br>
    • The stop-by-stop bar chart shows almost no stations got meaningfully more even train spacing<br>
    • The daily average headway boxplots are virtually identical pre vs. post (same median, same variability)<br>
    • Peak-hour headways (from the line chart in the notebook) remained unchanged</p>
    <p><strong>Final verdict:</strong> The MBTA delivered <strong>much faster trains</strong> — riders save 3–5+ minutes per trip — but <strong>did not deliver more reliable or more frequent trains</strong>. The next phase of Orange Line improvement must focus on operations, scheduling, and train availability, not just track condition.</p>
